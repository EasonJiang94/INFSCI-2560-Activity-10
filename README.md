GitHub Passport Example
========================

This app is a remix of the [Twitter Passport Example](https://glitch.com/~twitter-passport-example), modified for use with GitHub's oauth.

To bring your own remix to life, you'll need to visit GitHub's [app registration](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) page to create a new oauth app, then place the resulting ClientID, ClientSecret, and redirectUrl into the .env file.

## View the Code

On the back-end,
- the app starts at `server.js`
- frameworks and packages are in `package.json`
- app secrets are safely stored in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `index.html` and `success.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
